# Superstore Dashboard | Visual Analytics

## Project Overview
Created an interactive Tableau dashboard to analyze Superstore's historical performance across different states and sales categories, providing actionable business insights for strategic decision-making.

## Methodology

### 1. Problem Definition & Question Formulation
**Main Objective:** Provide an overview of company performance across states and sales categories

**Key Business Questions Developed:**
- **What is the average or total sales performance in each state?
- What are the profit margins from products in each subcategory within their respective categories?
- How have sales categories performed over time â€” which have grown or declined the most?
- How have discounting patterns and their impact on profit varied across different states over time?
- Which product categories are most profitable in each customer segment?
- Each question was designed to be answerable through visual analysis
- Questions focused on geographical performance, category trends, and sales patterns

### 2. Data Exploration & Visualization Design
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Investigated Superstore dataset to understand data structure and relationships
- **Iterative Design Process**: Tested multiple visualization types to determine optimal representation for each question
- **Dashboard Architecture**: Designed cohesive layout with five complementary visualizations

### 3. User Testing & Refinement
- **Peer Review Process**: Gathered feedback from colleagues on visualization clarity and effectiveness
- **Iterative Improvements**: Implemented suggestions including data labels and interactive toggles
- **Usability Testing**: Ensured visualizations were interpretable without prior context

## Technical Skills Applied
- **Data Visualization Principles**: Color theory, visual hierarchy, and chart selection
- **Interactive Dashboard Design**: User experience optimization and navigation flow
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Geographic performance mapping with clustering solutions
- **Business Intelligence**: KPI identification and performance metric visualization

## Key Learning Outcomes

### Visual Design Principles
- **Color Strategy**: Learned that RGB primary colors lack sophistication; implemented strategic color palettes using varied shades and tones
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Applied contrast and spacing to guide user attention to key insights

### User-Centered Design
- **Context Independence**: Realized visualizations must be self-explanatory without creator's domain knowledge
- **Cognitive Load**: Balanced information density with clarity (e.g., geographic clustering with toggle functionality)

### Project Management & Methodology
- **Agile Approach**: Embraced iterative design with milestone-based reviews
- **Scope Flexibility**: Learned to pivot research questions based on data availability and quality
- **Quality Assurance**: Implemented peer review process to catch usability issues before final delivery

### Business Intelligence Concepts
- **Performance Metrics**: Identified relevant KPIs for retail performance analysis
- **Trend Analysis**: Applied time-series analysis techniques to identify seasonal patterns

## Technologies Used
- **Tableau Desktop**: Primary visualization and dashboard creation tool
- **Data Preprocessing**: Data cleaning and preparation techniques
- **Statistical Analysis**: Descriptive statistics and trend identification
